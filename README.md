# ALS Alert System 
ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a condition which results in loss of voluntary control
of muscles and, in later stages, an inability to speak. The goal of this project is to develop 
a low-cost eye-triggered alert system for persons with ALS to communicate a need for assistance
when their caregivers are not nearby

##Standards
Since we are creating a medical device, there are several important codes and
 standards that we need to be aware of to support the safety and wellbeing
of those we are trying to assist. ISO 60601 requirements govern commercial
medical devices. Although we are not intending to commercialize our final device,
this standard can aid us in initially designing our device in a way that could streamline
future commercialization necessary.
